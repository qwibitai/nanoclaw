/**
 * Per-batch context the poll loop publishes for downstream consumers
 * (MCP tools, etc.) that don't sit on the poll-loop's call stack.
 *
 * Today the only field is `inReplyTo` — the id of the first inbound
 * message in the batch the agent is currently processing. MCP tools like
 * `send_message` and `send_file` read this and stamp it onto the outbound
 * row so the host's a2a return-path routing can correlate replies back to
 * the originating session.
 *
 * This is module-level state on purpose: the agent-runner is single-process
 * and processes one batch at a time. Poll-loop calls `setCurrentInReplyTo`
 * before invoking the provider and `clearCurrentInReplyTo` after the batch
 * completes (or errors out).
