# Prove edge before scaling capital not account size

## Core Insight

"Most assume it's their account size which is holding them back from success when in reality they have zero or little concrete evidence that they have an edge in the first place." - Luckshury

## The Small Account Trap

**Small account** (under $10k) creates psychological trap:
- Can't generate sustainable income at reasonable risk levels
- Brain tricks you into wanting exaggerated returns
- Desperately seeking returns to compensate for account size
- Results in "unhealthy relationship" with trading

## The Real Problem

Traders skip the fundamental step: **proving they have an edge**

Without proven edge:
- Sizing up just means losing faster
- Larger account wouldn't change outcome
- Risk taking becomes gambling, not calculated bets

## What "Proven Edge" Means

Before attempting to grow capital, validate edge by tracking:

1. **Drawdown metrics**: Both frequency AND depth
2. **Performance across market conditions**: Bull, bear, sideways markets
3. **Time horizon**: Takes YEARS of refinement
4. **Statistical significance**: Enough trades to distinguish edge from variance

## Edge Definition Framework

Build process by answering:
- Who are you trading against?
- Where do you want to get into the market?
- What do you want to see once price gets there?
- What do you NOT want to see there?

## The Correct Sequence

1. **Start small** (reduce size even further while learning)
2. **Prove edge** (years of consistent performance across conditions)
3. **Build capital** (save aggressively from day job during proving phase)
4. **Scale methodically** (slow stages, not instant jumps)
5. **Use math** (Kelly Criterion or similar, not "gut feeling")

## Application to Prediction Markets

For PM trading, proven edge means:
- Consistent probability estimation accuracy over hundreds of events
- Positive P&L across different event types (economic, political, crypto)
- Documented edge calculation (true_prob - market_prob) over time
- Drawdown tracking: frequency of wrong probability assessments

## Why This Matters

Prevents the most common path to failure:
1. Small account → desperation
2. Desperation → excessive risk
3. Excessive risk → account destruction
4. Repeat with next small account

Break cycle by proving edge first, then scaling.
