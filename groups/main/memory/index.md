# Knowledge Index

This is the hub MOC (Map of Content) for the memory space. All knowledge routes through here.

## Structure

Memory is organized as a flat directory of interconnected notes using wiki-style links `[[note title]]`.

### Principles

- **Atomic notes**: One idea per note
- **Prose-sentence titles**: Each note makes a claim in its title
- **Discovery-first**: Every note optimized for future findability
- **Progressive disclosure**: Title → Description → Full content

## Topics

*As knowledge accumulates, topic-level MOCs will be created here*

### User Preferences

- [[User prefers single asterisks for bold in WhatsApp messages]]
- [[User wants discovery-first memory design]]

### System Knowledge

- [[Ars Contexta provides research-backed agent memory architecture]]
