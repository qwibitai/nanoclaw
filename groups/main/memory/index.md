# Knowledge Index

This is the hub MOC (Map of Content) for the memory space. All knowledge routes through here.

## Structure

Memory is organized as a flat directory of interconnected notes using wiki-style links `[[note title]]`.

### Principles

- **Atomic notes**: One idea per note
- **Prose-sentence titles**: Each note makes a claim in its title
- **Discovery-first**: Every note optimized for future findability
- **Progressive disclosure**: Title → Description → Full content

## Topics

*As knowledge accumulates, topic-level MOCs will be created here*

### Topic MOCs

- [[Agent Architecture]] - Production agent systems, orchestration, and parallel execution (8 notes)

### User Preferences

- [[User prefers single asterisks for bold in WhatsApp messages]]
- [[User wants discovery-first memory design]]
- [[User prefers brief responses with option to elaborate]]

### System Knowledge

- [[Ars Contexta provides research-backed agent memory architecture]]
- [[Progress indicators help users track long-running tasks]]
- [[Monitor server API endpoints need absolute database paths]]

### Context Engineering

- [[Progressive disclosure uses three-level architecture for AI context]]
- [[JSONL format prevents agent data loss through append-only design]]
- [[Voice profiles should be structured data not adjectives]]
- [[Episodic memory requires separate files per memory type]]
- [[Cross-module references create knowledge graph for AI]]
- [[Auto-loading context dilutes agent attention]]

### Agent Orchestration

- [[Orchestration layer separates business context from coding context]]
- [[Git worktrees enable parallel agent execution without conflicts]]
- [[Proactive task discovery multiplies agent productivity]]
- [[Multi-model code review catches different error types]]
- [[Orchestrator agent bottleneck is human attention not agent capability]]
- [[Self-improving systems compound when agents build their own tools]]
- [[Production agents require state persistence not request-response architecture]]
- [[Engineer role splits into environment builder and work manager with AI agents]]

### Documentation & Configuration

- [[CLAUDE.md should be under 100 lines with progressive disclosure]]
- [[Three-layer documentation system prevents context overload]]
- [[Skill manifests should specify when to use and when not to use]]

### Code Quality & Enforcement

- [[Write-time enforcement catches LLM code quality issues before commit]]

### Trading & Market Strategies

- [[Judge systems by distributions not individual outcomes]]
- [[Pre-accepting failure rates enables rational decision making]]
- [[Multi-agent LLM systems outperform single agents in trading]]
- [[End-of-day trading reduces emotional interference in momentum strategies]]
- [[Volatility contraction patterns signal momentum continuation setups]]
- [[Prediction markets require probability-based strategies not stock strategies]]
- [[Prove edge before scaling capital not account size]]
- [[Size based on math not gut feeling for exponential growth]]

### Users

User profiles and context are stored in the `users/` directory with phone-number filenames.
