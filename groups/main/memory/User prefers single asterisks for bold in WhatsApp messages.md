# User prefers single asterisks for bold in WhatsApp messages

When formatting messages for WhatsApp, use single asterisks (*text*) for bold, not double asterisks (**text**).

## Rationale

WhatsApp's markdown parser interprets:
- `*text*` → **bold**
- `_text_` → _italic_
- `` `text` `` → `code`
- ` ```text``` ` → code block

Double asterisks don't render correctly in WhatsApp and appear as literal asterisks.

## Formatting Guidelines

**Use:**
- Single asterisks for *bold*
- Underscores for _italic_
- Bullet points (•) for lists
- Triple backticks for code blocks

**Avoid:**
- Markdown headings (##)
- Double asterisks
- Complex nested formatting

## Application

This applies to all WhatsApp messaging contexts across all groups.
