# End-of-day trading reduces emotional interference in momentum strategies

**Context: Swing trading and momentum strategies**

Most swing traders enter positions in the morning or throughout the day, exposing themselves to intraday volatility, noise, and emotional reactions. End-of-day entry eliminates this.

## The Core Principle

**Traditional swing trading**:
- Enter in morning or intraday
- Watch position fluctuate all day
- React to every move
- Emotional stress and second-guessing

**End-of-day approach**:
- Enter in last 2 minutes of trading day (3:58pm EST)
- No intraday watching
- No emotional reactions
- Clean decision based on daily setup

## Why This Works

**Gives you a massive edge** (contrary to popular belief this is "wrong" or "late"):

1. **Time commitment**: Trading <30 min/day (98% of time free)
2. **No emotional stress**: Can't react emotionally to intraday moves
3. **Better win rate**: 65% (medium win rate means low drawdown, low time in drawdown, few losers in row)
4. **Statistical advantage**: Understand the distribution of your system

## The Psychology

**Problem with early entry**:
- Morning entry at 1:5 RR → big drawdowns
- Can spend 9 months in drawdowns
- 10-15 losers in row is common
- Equity curve flat with huge spikes

**Result**: Distribution nightmare to stay consistent with. Most traders can't handle it psychologically.

**End-of-day solution**:
- 65% win rate
- 80% of months profitable
- 13% max drawdown
- 8 losers in row only once every 2-3 years

## Key Statistics

From Felipe's system:
- **65% of trades positive**
- **80% of months profitable**
- **13% max drawdown**
- **8 losers in row** once every 2-3 years only
- **Average 100%+ returns per year**
- **Very low max DD** (~13%)
- **Time/mind freedom** for job/business/family

## Risk-First Approach

**Not designed to**:
- Take 50k to 5M at all costs

**Designed to**:
- Grow wealth consistently (avg 100%+)
- Very low max DD (~13%)
- Time/mind freedom

**Philosophy**: Nobody who worked 20 years to build capital wants 300%+ return if that means 30%+ drawdowns.

## Distribution Understanding

**Critical insight**: If you have a 35% success rate trading style, by statistical distribution you will have 10 losers in a row.

**Most traders**: Copy their favorite trader, get 9 losers in row, think it's "not working", and drop to something else, walking away with losses.

**Understanding distribution**: Nothing wrong with that. If you're not aware because you copy, you might get 9 losers in row and abandon a working system.
