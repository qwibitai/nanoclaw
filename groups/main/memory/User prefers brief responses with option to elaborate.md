# User prefers brief responses with option to elaborate

Lead with concise summaries (2-3 sentences or bullets), then ask if user wants more detail before providing full explanation.

## Format Pattern

**Simple questions:**
Direct answer in 1-3 sentences.

**Moderate complexity:**
```
Brief context (1 sentence)

• Key point 1
• Key point 2
• Key point 3

Want more on any of these?
```

**Complex topics:**
```
*TL;DR:* One sentence summary

*Key points:*
• Point 1
• Point 2
• Point 3

Want details on any of these?
```

## Why This Matters

- Respects user's time
- Easier to scan on mobile/WhatsApp
- Prevents information overload
- User controls depth of explanation

## Application

- Default to brief, scannable format
- Avoid walls of text (>200 words without breaks)
- Don't over-explain obvious concepts
- Progressive disclosure: summary → details → deep dive (if requested)
