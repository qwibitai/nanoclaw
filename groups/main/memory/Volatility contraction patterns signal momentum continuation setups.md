# Volatility contraction patterns signal momentum continuation setups

**Context: Swing trading momentum stocks**

Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) is a specific consolidation formation that signals high-probability continuation of momentum. Not all consolidations are equal.

## What is VCP

**Volatility Contraction Pattern**:
- Consolidation after breakout from base
- Trendlines converge (volatility contracts)
- Price coils tighter and tighter
- Breakout from VCP = second leg of trend

**Why it matters**: The first valid consolidation after a breakout, when it shows volatility contraction, sets up the second leg of the intermediate trend, which is **always the strongest** (and gives high probability trade).

## VCP Qualification Criteria

**Strict requirements** (Felipe's system):

1. **Consolidation must be at least 7 days from high before breakout**
   - Gives time for pattern to form
   - Filters out noise

2. **There must be volatility contraction** (trendlines converge, not expand)
   - Narrowing range
   - Coiling action
   - Not widening volatility

3. **Consolidation must touch the 8/20 EMA layer**
   - Price pulls back to support
   - Healthy consolidation depth

4. **No daily close below the 20 EMA**
   - Maintains trend integrity
   - Above key moving average

## The Setup Pattern

**Step 1**: Stock breaks out from multi-week/month base
- Establishes first leg of new trend
- Fresh momentum

**Step 2**: First valid consolidation (VCP)
- 7+ days from high
- Volatility contracts
- Touches 8/20 EMA layer
- No close below 20 EMA

**Step 3**: Breakout from VCP
- Strong range expansion candle
- No big wick on upper side
- Closes above resistance
- Enter at close before 4:00 pm EST

## Why Second Leg is Strongest

**Market mechanics**:
- First breakout attracts early buyers
- Consolidation shakes out weak hands
- VCP forms tight coil
- Breakout from VCP has less resistance
- Strongest momentum in second leg

**High probability trade**: Targeting the second leg of intermediate trend after first valid consolidation.

## Entry Specifics

**Breakout candle requirements**:
- Strong range expansion candle
- Bigger and stronger than 2 preceding candles
- No big wick on upper side
- Closes above resistance line (level or down trendline)

**Timing**:
- Enter at the close before 4:00 pm EST (more on this in end-of-day trading)

## Risk Management

**Stop loss**: Below the LOD (Low Of Day)

**Time stop**: 5-day move
- After 5 days, exit if not working
- Prevents capital tie-up

**Profit target**:
- Move stop to BE after price reaches 1:1 RR level
- Let winners run with trailing stop
