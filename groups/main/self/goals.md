## Deferred

*Nothing deferred at this time*

## Recently Completed

- **Ars Contexta Integration** (PR #6, merged) — Three-space architecture (self/, memory/, ops/), identity.md, methodology.md, discovery-first memory design

## Learnings This Session

- Knowledge system drifts when feature branches merge without updating memory/goals
- Processing skills (/remember, /reflect, /review) needed as invocable skills, not just documentation references
- Post-merge automation can prevent future knowledge drift

## Next Session

When starting next session:
1. Review this goals file for context
2. Check `ops/queue/` for pending knowledge updates
3. Check ops/observations/ for any friction points
4. Run `/review` if queue entries are pending
