# Add Karpathy LLM Wiki

Set up a persistent wiki knowledge base on NanoClaw, based on Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern.

## Step 1: Read the pattern

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/llm-wiki.md` — this is the full LLM Wiki idea as written by Karpathy. Understand it thoroughly before proceeding. Summarize the core idea to the user briefly, then discuss what they want to build.

## Step 2: Choose a group

AskUserQuestion: "Which group should have the wiki?"

1. **Main group** — add to your existing main chat
2. **Dedicated group** — create a new group just for the wiki
3. **Other** — pick an existing group

If dedicated: ask which channel and chat, then register with `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step register`.

## Step 3: Design collaboratively

Discuss with the user based on the pattern:
- What's the wiki's domain or topic?
- What kinds of sources will they add? (URLs, PDFs, images, voice notes, books, transcripts)
- Do they want the full three-layer architecture or a lighter version?
- Any specific conventions they care about? (The pattern intentionally leaves this open.)

Based on this discussion, create three things:

### 3a. Directory structure

Create `wiki/` and `sources/` directories in the group folder. Create initial `index.md` and `log.md` per the pattern's Indexing and Logging section. Adapt to the user's domain.

### 3b. Container skill

Create a `container/skills/wiki/SKILL.md` tailored to this user's wiki. This is the schema layer from the pattern — it tells the agent how to maintain the wiki. Base it on the pattern's Operations section (ingest, query, lint) and the conventions you agreed on with the user. Don't over-prescribe — the pattern says "your LLM figures out the rest."

### 3c. Group AGENTS.md

Edit the group's AGENTS.md to add a wiki section. This is critical — it's what turns the agent into a wiki maintainer. It should:

- Explain the wiki system concisely: what it is, the three layers (sources, wiki, schema), the three operations (ingest, query, lint)
- Index the key files and folders (`wiki/`, `sources/`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`)
- Point to the container skill for detailed workflow
- **Ingest discipline:** Be very explicit that when the user provides multiple files or points at a folder with many files, the agent MUST process them one at a time. For each file: read it, discuss takeaways, create/update all wiki pages (summary, entities, concepts, cross-references, index, log), and completely finish with that file before moving to the next. Never batch-read all files and then process them together — this produces shallow, generic pages instead of the deep integration the pattern requires.

## Step 4: Source handling capabilities

Based on the source types the user plans to ingest (discussed in Step 3), check whether the agent can already handle those formats — some are supported natively, others need a skill (e.g. `/add-image-vision`, `/add-pdf-reader`, `/add-voice-transcription`). If a needed capability isn't installed, check if there's an available skill for it and help the user get it set up.

### URL handling note

Codex has built-in `WebFetch`, but it returns a summary, not the full document. For wiki ingestion of a URL where the full text matters, the container skill and AGENTS.md should instruct Codex to use bash commands to download full files instead. For example:

```bash
curl -sLo sources/filename.pdf "<url>"
```

If the document is a webpage, then Codex can use fetch or `agent-browser` to open the page and extract full text if available. The container skill and AGENTS.md should note this so Codex gets full content for sources rather than summaries.


## Step 5: Optional lint schedule

AskUserQuestion: "Want periodic wiki health checks?"

1. **Weekly**
2. **Monthly**
3. **Skip** — lint manually

If yes, create a NanoClaw scheduler job that runs in the wiki group. This is NOT a Codex cron job — it's a NanoClaw scheduler job that runs in the agent container. Insert it into the SQLite database:

```bash
npx tsx -e "
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const { CronExpressionParser } = require('cron-parser');
const db = new Database('store/messages.db');
const interval = CronExpressionParser.parse('<cron-expr>', { tz: process.env.TZ || 'UTC' });
const nextRun = interval.next().toISOString();
db.prepare('INSERT INTO jobs (id, name, prompt, script, schedule_type, schedule_value, status, linked_sessions, group_scope, created_by, created_at, updated_at, next_run, timeout_ms, max_retries, retry_backoff_ms, max_consecutive_failures, consecutive_failures) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)').run(
  'wiki-lint-<group_folder>',
  'wiki lint',
  'Run a wiki lint pass per the wiki container skill. Check for contradictions, orphan pages, stale content, missing cross-references, and gaps. Report findings and offer to fix issues.',
  null,
  'cron',
  '<cron-expr>',
  'active',
  JSON.stringify(['<chat_jid>']),
  '<group_folder>',
  'human',
  new Date().toISOString(),
  new Date().toISOString(),
  nextRun,
  300000,
  3,
  5000,
  5,
  0
);
db.close();
"
```

Use the group's `folder` and `chat_jid` from the registered groups table. Cron expressions: `0 10 * * 0` (weekly Sunday 10am) or `0 10 1 * *` (monthly 1st at 10am).

## Step 6: Build and restart

```bash
npm run build
./container/build.sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # macOS
# Linux: systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

Tell the user to test by sending a source to the wiki group.
