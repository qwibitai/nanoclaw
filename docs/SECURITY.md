# NanoClaw Security Model

## Trust Model

| Entity | Trust Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Main group | Trusted | Private self-chat, admin control |
| Non-main groups | Untrusted | Other users may be malicious |
| Container agents | Sandboxed | Isolated execution environment |
| Incoming messages | User input | Potential prompt injection |

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Container Isolation (Primary Boundary)

Agents execute in containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Process isolation** - Container processes cannot affect the host
- **Filesystem isolation** - Only explicitly mounted directories are visible
- **Non-root execution** - Runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000)
- **Ephemeral containers** - Fresh environment per invocation (`--rm`)

This is the primary security boundary. Rather than relying on application-level permission checks, the attack surface is limited by what's mounted.

### 2. Mount Security

**External Allowlist** - Mount permissions stored at `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`, which is:
- Outside project root
- Never mounted into containers
- Cannot be modified by agents

**Default Blocked Patterns:**
```
.ssh, .gnupg, .aws, .azure, .gcloud, .kube, .docker,
credentials, .env, .netrc, .npmrc, id_rsa, id_ed25519,
private_key, .secret
```

**Protections:**
- Symlink resolution before validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- Container path validation (rejects `..` and absolute paths)
- `nonMainReadOnly` option forces read-only for non-main groups

**Read-Only Project Root:**

The main group's project root is mounted read-only. Writable paths the agent needs (group folder, IPC, `.claude/`) are mounted separately. This prevents the agent from modifying host application code (`src/`, `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.) which would bypass the sandbox entirely on next restart.

### 3. Session Isolation

Each group has isolated Claude sessions at `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/`:
- Groups cannot see other groups' conversation history
- Session data includes full message history and file contents read
- Prevents cross-group information disclosure

### 4. IPC Authorization

Messages and task operations are verified against group identity:

| Operation | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Send message to own chat | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send message to other chats | ✓ | ✗ |
| Schedule task for self | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schedule task for others | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all tasks | ✓ | Own only |
| Manage other groups | ✓ | ✗ |

### 5. Credential Isolation (OneCLI Agent Vault)

Real API credentials **never enter containers**. NanoClaw uses [OneCLI's Agent Vault](https://github.com/onecli/onecli) to proxy outbound requests and inject credentials at the gateway level.

**How it works (API Key / OAuth):**
1. Credentials are registered once with `onecli secrets create`, stored and managed by OneCLI
2. When NanoClaw spawns a container, it calls `applyContainerConfig()` to route outbound HTTPS through the OneCLI gateway
3. The gateway matches requests by host and path, injects the real credential, and forwards
4. Agents cannot discover real credentials — not in environment, stdin, files, or `/proc`

**Per-agent policies:**
Each NanoClaw group gets its own OneCLI agent identity. This allows different credential policies per group (e.g. your sales agent vs. support agent). OneCLI supports rate limits, and time-bound access and approval flows are on the roadmap.

**How it works (Vertex AI):**
1. The same credential proxy handles Vertex AI requests
2. Containers receive `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:<port>` and `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`
3. The SDK sends Vertex AI requests to the proxy with no real Google auth
4. The proxy obtains Google OAuth2 tokens using host-side Application Default Credentials, injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and forwards to `{region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com`
5. GCP credentials never enter the container — no mounted `.gcloud` directory, no credentials file, no service account keys

**NOT Mounted:**
- Channel auth sessions (`store/auth/`) — host only
- Mount allowlist — external, never mounted
- GCP credentials directory (`.gcloud`) — blocked pattern
- Any credentials matching blocked patterns
- `.env` is shadowed with `/dev/null` in the project root mount

## Privilege Comparison

| Capability | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Project root access | `/workspace/project` (ro) | None |
| Group folder | `/workspace/group` (rw) | `/workspace/group` (rw) |
| Global memory | Implicit via project | `/workspace/global` (ro) |
| Additional mounts | Configurable | Read-only unless allowed |
| Network access | Unrestricted | Unrestricted |
| MCP tools | All | All |
