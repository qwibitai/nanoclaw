# Dockerfile for Railway deployment.
# Runs the NanoClaw orchestrator and agent-runner directly as Node.js processes.
# No Docker-in-Docker required — agents run as child processes of the main app.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   Create two persistent volumes in the Railway dashboard:
#     /app/store   — SQLite database + WhatsApp auth credentials
#     /app/groups  — Per-group CLAUDE.md memory files
