# Telegram Channel Setup

Telegram is NanoClaw's default (and only) channel. This skill helps with bot creation, configuration, and registration.

## Setup

### Create Telegram Bot (if needed)

If the user doesn't have a bot token, tell them:

> I need you to create a Telegram bot:
>
> 1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
> 2. Send `/newbot` and follow prompts:
>    - Bot name: Something friendly (e.g., "Andy Assistant")
>    - Bot username: Must end with "bot" (e.g., "andy_ai_bot")
> 3. Copy the bot token (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`)

Wait for the user to provide the token.

### Configure environment

Add to `.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<their-token>
```

Sync to container environment:

```bash
mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env
```

The container reads environment from `data/env/env`, not `.env` directly.

### Disable Group Privacy (for group chats)

Tell the user:

> **Important for group chats**: By default, Telegram bots only see @mentions and commands in groups. To let the bot see all messages:
>
> 1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
> 2. Send `/mybots` and select your bot
> 3. Go to **Bot Settings** > **Group Privacy** > **Turn off**
>
> This is optional if you only want trigger-based responses via @mentioning the bot.

### Build and restart

```bash
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # macOS
# Linux: systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Registration

### Get Chat ID

Tell the user:

> 1. Open your bot in Telegram (search for its username)
> 2. Send `/chatid` — it will reply with the chat ID
> 3. For groups: add the bot to the group first, then send `/chatid` in the group

Wait for the user to provide the chat ID (format: `tg:123456789` or `tg:-1001234567890`).

### Register the chat

Use the IPC register flow or register directly. The chat ID, name, and folder name are needed.

For a main chat (responds to all messages, uses the `main` folder):

```typescript
registerGroup("tg:<chat-id>", {
  name: "<chat-name>",
  folder: "main",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: false,
});
```

For additional chats (trigger-only):

```typescript
registerGroup("tg:<chat-id>", {
  name: "<chat-name>",
  folder: "<folder-name>",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: true,
});
```

## Verify

### Test the connection

Tell the user:

> Send a message to your registered Telegram chat:
> - For main chat: Any message works
> - For non-main: `@Andy hello` or @mention the bot
>
> The bot should respond within a few seconds.

### Check logs if needed

```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding

Check:
1. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set in `.env` AND synced to `data/env/env`
2. Chat is registered in SQLite (check with: `sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT * FROM registered_groups WHERE jid LIKE 'tg:%'"`)
3. For non-main chats: message includes trigger pattern
4. Service is running: `launchctl list | grep nanoclaw` (macOS) or `systemctl --user status nanoclaw` (Linux)

### Bot only responds to @mentions in groups

Group Privacy is enabled (default). Fix:
1. `@BotFather` > `/mybots` > select bot > **Bot Settings** > **Group Privacy** > **Turn off**
2. Remove and re-add the bot to the group (required for the change to take effect)

### Getting chat ID

If `/chatid` doesn't work:
- Verify token: `curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getMe"`
- Check bot is started: `tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log`

## Agent Swarms (Teams)

After completing the Telegram setup, use `AskUserQuestion`:

AskUserQuestion: Would you like to add Agent Swarm support? Without it, Agent Teams still work — they just operate behind the scenes. With Swarm support, each subagent appears as a different bot in the Telegram group so you can see who's saying what and have interactive team sessions.

If they say yes, invoke the `/add-telegram-swarm` skill.
