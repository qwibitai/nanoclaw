# Manage Mounts

Configure which host directories NanoClaw agent containers can access. The mount allowlist lives at `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`.

## Show Current Config

```bash
cat ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json 2>/dev/null || echo "No mount allowlist configured"
```

Show the current config to the user in a readable format: which directories are allowed, whether non-main agents are read-only.

## Built-in Host-Managed Mounts (Informational)

Every agent container also gets these host-managed mounts wired by NanoClaw itself. They are NOT in the allowlist file and cannot be removed via this skill — they're part of the runtime contract:

| Container path | Source | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/workspace` | `data/v2-sessions/<session-id>/` | RW | Session DBs (`inbound.db`, `outbound.db`), heartbeat, working files |
| `/workspace/agent` | `groups/<folder>/` | RW | Per-group memory (`CLAUDE.local.md`), agent's working dir |
| `/workspace/agent/container.json` | `groups/<folder>/container.json` | RO | Per-group config the runner reads at startup |
| `/workspace/skill-data` | `data/v2-sessions/<group-id>/skill-data/` | RW | Per-group persistent skill state, survives restarts |
| `/home/node/.claude` | `data/v2-sessions/<group-id>/.claude-shared/` | RW | Claude Code state (settings.json, plugins/, skill symlinks) |
| `/workspace/global` | `groups/global/` | RO | Cross-group shared memory (if present) |
| `/app/skills` | `container/skills/` | RO | Shared skill source — symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` point here |
| `/app/src` | `container/agent-runner/src/` | RO | Agent-runner source code |

When auditing the per-group write surface, list these alongside the operator-allowlist mounts. Anything writable inside a container is one of: a per-session/per-group host-managed dir (above), or an entry from `~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json`.

## Add Directories

Ask which directories the user wants agents to access. For each path:
- Validate the path exists
- Ask if it should be read-only for non-main agents (default: yes)

Build the JSON config and write it:

```bash
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step mounts --force -- --json '{"allowedRoots":[{"path":"/path/to/dir","readOnly":false}],"blockedPatterns":[],"nonMainReadOnly":true}'
```

Use `--force` to overwrite the existing config.

## Remove Directories

Read the current config, show it, ask which entry to remove, write the updated config.

## Reset to Empty

```bash
npx tsx setup/index.ts --step mounts --force -- --empty
```

## After Changes

Restart the service so containers pick up the new config:

- macOS: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw`
- Linux: `systemctl --user restart nanoclaw`
