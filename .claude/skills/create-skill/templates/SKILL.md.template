## Phase 2: Apply Code Changes

Run the skills engine to apply this skill's code package. The package files are in this directory alongside this SKILL.md.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts --init
```

### Apply the skill

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/{{SKILL_NAME}}

This deterministically:
