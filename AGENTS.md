# AGENTS.md

## Instruction Source
- Read and follow `CLAUDE.md` as the single source of truth for repository instructions, including upstream sync policy.
- At the start of every task, load `CLAUDE.md` first, then follow its `Docs Index` trigger lines for progressive disclosure.
- Run the task-start skill/MCP routing preflight defined by `CLAUDE.md` before ad-hoc implementation/debugging.
- If `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` ever conflict, `CLAUDE.md` wins.
